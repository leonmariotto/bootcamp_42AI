The equation 
h(x) = Theta0 + Theta1 * x 
is like
h(x) = Theta0 * 1 + Theta1 * x 
same as
[Theta0, Theta1] * [1, x]
We add 1 for Theta0

It's in the var equation, it's useful for make this value absolute

Itself the cost function output mean nothing. But it can be used
to compare the efficiency of hypothesis functions. That's our measure of
performance P in Tom Mitchell's definition of machine learning (1997).

We want cost function equal to 0. That would mean our prediction is perfect.

Yes. No commutative means :
A . B neql B . A
It's because we multiply the rows by the column. And we change the shape
of the matrix by :
[ m x n ] . [ n x o ] = [ m x o ]
In most case matrix multiplication are not commutative.
